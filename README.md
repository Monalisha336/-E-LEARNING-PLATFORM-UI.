Designing the front-end for an e-learning platform involves creating a user-friendly and responsive interface that allows users to explore courses, track their progress, and engage with learning content through embedded videos. Using HTML and CSS, the interface can be structured in a clean and organized manner, focusing on accessibility and usability. The homepage or dashboard typically includes a navigation bar for easy access to sections like Home, Courses, Progress, and Profile. A dedicated **course listing section** displays available courses in a card layout, each card containing the course title, a brief description, and a “Start” or “Continue” button. This layout allows learners to quickly browse and select from the available content.

The **video embedding feature** is essential for delivering lessons. This is usually placed within a lesson or course detail page, using `<iframe>` to embed video content from platforms like YouTube or a custom server. Videos are styled to be responsive and adaptable to various screen sizes, ensuring a smooth learning experience across devices. Below the video, additional content such as transcripts, notes, or quizzes can be added for a richer learning experience.

The **progress tracking** feature visually represents the learner’s advancement through a course. This can be implemented using a simple progress bar styled with CSS, where the width dynamically reflects how much of the course is completed. While the front-end doesn't handle logic, it sets up the structure for integration with back-end data or APIs.

Overall, the design focuses on clarity, simplicity, and functionality, allowing users to navigate easily, watch videos, and see their learning progress at a glance. It lays the foundation for an interactive, scalable, and visually appealing learning platform that can be enhanced further with JavaScript or front-end frameworks.
